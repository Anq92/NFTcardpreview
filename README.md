## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned about pseudoclasses and tested clamp() function, which helped me to make the element responsive for smaller screen sizes - I tried to keep proportions of some elements similar for every size.

### Continued development

I need to practice more usage of pseudoclasses and hover effects, because some behaviours of CSS code I tried to use were sometimes unexpected :)

I'm going to learn about CSS variables and Sass and I'll try to use it in my next projects.

### Useful resources
